    <h1>Leadership and Business: My Time in The Army and Business</h1>
    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Served in the US Army from 2000 - 2005, as a Cavalry Scout (19D)</li>
        <li>Deployed to Kuwait from 2000 - 2001 (pre-9/11)</li>
        <li>19 years old, became a Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO)</li>
        <li>Deployed to Iraq from 2004 - 2005 (OIF II)</li>
        <li>Worked at USAA, US Air Force (Civil Service)</li>
        <li>Owner at Let Us Not Forget, J.Moua Consulting, LP for a Bar and Grill, Realtor</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning Objectives:
      <ul>
        <li>Selfless Service, What Does it Mean?</li>
        <li>How to Build a Team</li>
        <li>How to Build Business Systems</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Selfless Service</h2>
    <p>The Army's Definition:</p>
    <p>
      "Put the welfare of the nation, the Army and your subordinates before your own. Selfless service is larger than just one person. In serving your country, you are doing your duty loyally without thought of recognition or gain. The basic building block of selfless service is the commitment of each team member to go a little further, endure a little longer, and look a little closer to see how he or she can add to the effort."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Army leaders eat last, placing the needs of their soldiers above their own.  A good leader also knows that soldiers fight and grind all day while they delegate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doing the little things can go along way, i.e. Staying behind to work on a Humvee, Pulling Guard Duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the civilian sector I was call on a weekend by the company's Director of Business Operations(DBO) to prepare for a briefing with the CEO regarding a poorly managed contract.  I came into work that afternoon and left shortly after midnight on a Saturday.  When I came into work the following Monday, the DBO was thankful for my commitment but said he wasn't expect me to come in in the weekend to work on the briefing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take Away:
      <ul>
        <li>Don't work for a paycheck, work to learn</li>
        <li>Strive to be the first person in the office and the last person to leave</li>
        <li>Do your daily tasks and when they are completed, help members of your team</li>
        <li>Treat your job as if it were your company</li>
        <li>Treat people with respect</li>
        <li>Management will take notice</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Building A Team</h2>
    <p>
      A team is about building relationships among individuals in order to accomplish a mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Staying alive is a big motivator, but team building doesn't start on the battlefield.  It takes months and years of training to create an effective team, i.e. new member to gun-truck, new member to platoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a civilian supervisor, I established weekly morning meetings. Worked closely with members on their contracts and took time to talk with them on a personal basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      When engaging on a task/mission:
      <ul>
        <li>Provide an overview of mission</li>
        <li>Brief members of the mission objectives</li>
        <li>Inform members how they fit into the mission</li>
        <li>Ask opinions and questions (engage members and give them a sense of ownership)</li>
        <li>Run drills, (worst-case and best-case scenarios)</li>
        <li>Everyone should know their duty and the learn the duties of other members</li>
        <li>After Action Report (Providing Feedback)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Take Away:
      <ul>
        <li>Take time to get to know co-workers.  You'll never know who they might become in the future</li>
        <li>Lead from the front/ by example</li>
        <li>Leaders do the right thing, managers do things right</li>
        <li>Be humble, you don't know everything</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Building Systems</h2>
    <p>
      Business Systems == Business Processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Systems are important because they help ease our daily grind.
      Building system is about identifying actions required to do something.
      Think about Henry Ford and the assembly line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Managers follow systems, while leaders identify and create systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Army I took the job of the each crew member and created it into a business system.  Each member was given a step-by-step process of what they needed to do in that respective job.  The next ranking member was in charge of the junior members, this created a check-and-balance process.  I would just have to communicate with one member to ensure everything was up and running.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was later asked what my process was by a Corporal, who was interested in what he should do when he got to my position.  It was a moment of mentoring and teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took this concept with me and created systems to ease my daily workflow in business.  I taught construction contracting to a young lieutenant using the company's business process which I modified to make more efficient.  Shortly thereafter, I was promoted to a management position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take Away:
      <ul>
        <li>Identify and develop a business system at work</li>
        <li>You can teach your system to new teammates</li>
        <li>Building systems helps you identify areas for improvement</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
